## A slide with an ordered list

We're going to talk about this stuff:

1. Data
2. Bayes
3. The airspeed velocity of unladen swallows


## A slide with an unordered list

- First important thing
- Second important thing

## A slide with code (and a table)

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

mtcars1 <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl, gear) %>%
  tally()
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(mtcars1, caption = 'A count of cars', format = 'html') %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c('striped'))
```

## A slide with a plot

```{r, cars, fig.cap = "A scatterplot", echo = FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
